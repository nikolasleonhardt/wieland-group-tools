# wieland-group-tools
Collection of various tools developed for and used in the Wieland group at Heidelberg University.
## 1. System requirements
### 1.1 OS
These scripts should function on any operating system that can run Python 3 and the required libraries listed below.
The scripts have been tested on a Macbook Air M2 (16GB) running macOS Sequoia 15.3.
### 1.2 Python
This software was tested using Python 3.13.1. However it should also work for other versions of python that support the required python libraries listed below.
### 1.3 Python libraries
The library requirements for these scripts can also be found in the 'requirements.txt' file, but they are also listed below:

1. Numpy version 1.24.3
2. Matplotlib version 3.7.1
3. Pandas version 2.2.3
4. Scipy version 1.15.1

It is very likely that configurations that are not too far from the versions listed above will work just fine, but no guarantee can be made.
### 1.4 Non-standard hardware
No non-standard hardware is required to run the scripts.
