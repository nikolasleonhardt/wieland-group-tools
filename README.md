# wieland-group-tools
Collection of various tools developed for and used in the Wieland group at Heidelberg University.

## 1. System requirements
### 1.1 OS

These scripts should function on any operating system that can run Python 3 and the required libraries listed below.
The scripts have been tested on a Macbook Air M2 (16GB) running macOS Sequoia 15.3.

### 1.2 Python

This software was tested using Python 3.13.1. However it should also work for other versions of python that support the required python libraries listed below.

### 1.3 Python libraries

The library requirements for these scripts can also be found in the 'requirements.txt' file, but they are also listed below:

1. Numpy version 1.24.3
2. Matplotlib version 3.7.1
3. Pandas version 2.2.3
4. Scipy version 1.15.1

It is very likely that configurations that are not too far from the versions listed above will work just fine, but no guarantee can be made.
### 1.4 Non-standard hardware
No non-standard hardware is required to run the scripts.
## 2. Installation guide
### 2.1 Python 3
First, install Python 3 to run the scripts. The version we used, can be found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/).
Follow the instructions given there to install Python. 
### 2.2 Repository
Clone the repository into a directory of your choice, or simply download the files and save them anywhere on your computer.
### 2.3 Python libraries
Our script uses a variety of publically available python libraries, listed under **1.3 Python libraries**. You can either install them manually or simply use the supplemented *requirements.txt* file with pip via the command:
> pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
### 2.4 Install time
All in all the installation should not take longer than 10 minutes on a "*normal*" desktop computer. However, this can of course vary, depending on internet speed and CPU power.
